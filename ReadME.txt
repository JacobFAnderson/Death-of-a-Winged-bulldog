__AUTHOR_OF_	WANDERING	 SALESMEN__


         To my family and friends,
         who fought for me 
                                 -JA 


Remember that time she slapped your dick
 now, after experts and scientists viewed the footage
even after sherlock himself had looked in on it
maybe it wasn't an accident.

Gave_it_a_shot
--------------------------
    all for the best
pleasures for 	frightening	 the best
on a broadcast station that
	 won't be written about in
nostaglic forums, never bought up
but that reboot would have been
  pretty awesome 


Girl_Whisperer
--------------------------
Love on the third look 
better than the fourth 
which is a hometown divider 
If it doesn't happen by the third
then fingers       crossed for the   fifth
       if only you looked at the wrong Middle



Wildabeast
--------------------------
Kept to ourselves when it didn't matter
and paid for her own words, hanging by shroom limelight
put that shit        back
Think this is a fucking joke?
laughing all the way home with cups that
      soaked through
her eyes like this        if only



WildabeastII
--------------------------
          Wept to the sound of vomtting in the car
you have to pull your head back slightly, straighten out your bull stomach

 Throw the bag in the street because you missed the trashcan
She'll never let me forget it

 but I did 
          brine liquid that could eat up ships
In her eyes, she'll scold me for sushing her in 
in kung fu panda 3
Never throw up in the theater again


Rose
--------------------------
charming 	poor	    with     
       middle name


a          lways call      me with an iphone
pushed against a grill that never      holds 
the light just right

           you better get that iphone
   my words won't sound good otherwise


Build_IT
--------------------------
determined to blow it out of proportion, I cheated, I didn't cheat enough    
  middle vowel between tongues and legs of obstructions 
Never bold enough, the font, to catch a new infection
sick within hours of the excedrin and for three days after

 I wrecked a toilet and felt bad enough to clean it before the orderlies did

 That virus that people can smell on you, blue river between
killing and killed. Only letters seperate us from the dead


Best_Bundle2
--------------------------
      he  r tons of bullet mashed clothing 
  ripp    ing the taste out of her mouth 
Metal the last copper test
she   dies within h   ours

 and left her bones for the res t of us



Trust_is_a_closed_Book
--------------------------
Is this where you operate? Where you click hands and ears
Craddle of ten tons, crush a car or an elephant with pressure
Cant catch a cold if you're moving   to      fast


*********************
THE_HUNK_AND_I

*********************


The_Romantics
--------------------------
Waste space touching old posters and flinging records off the cliff
The sound is crisp, a low low billow that brightens the corners   aces to places
The shards are black obsidion
I burried the record out behind the tree I cut down for her
First love is never enough love
it lasts too               long
burning and pacing the hand you've never drawn

You know something honey? It won't end well
for me, and it won't mean well for you



VirtualGettinIt
--------------------------
 I gave her one, they gave him two

two one, her gives they what they gave  


Virtious_Game_Changer
--------------------------
More More More

phine she screams, when four mg isn't enough
      and ring with your arms up in the air
watch the orderlies play rock paper siccsrs for bringing your meds
and up for seven o clock blood draws for medication levels



Too_Much_Time_With_Chronos
--------------------------
 as flustered I'm persisted
 carried This of sun, conquest. head. and no the must
whole the world to see. Poor the pay! This is the bissmark



Follow_with_care
--------------------------
Crafter with loose ships and sinking lips
Cant you see we are working?

 hard on the tip of the dick
Two modes, Horny and Hungry
First kiss doesn't have anything
on curb side blow jobs
Miracle on the eight mile
never letting her drive again



Holding_Gold
--------------------------
 streaked from the hearth to the bathroom 
 feet clicking on rapped tile and wet towels
He checks himself, again, and can't bend it back
 Wasted enough that it doesn't hurt
 but it's going too
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



Marinol
--------------------------
 Alex smokes some fucking weed 
and pills from under grandmas sink
tried and true. obscure. the dates are always older than me
Bird house in the sink, cumming all in your pants when she comes over
skittles but all by himself
A great many things are wrong with him
 And boils are never as sharp as the tacs



Marinol2
--------------------------
 bowed graced with simple pleasures    god can replace laxatives with anything
          trim that water down to fit in the sink
her       ass         breaks      bones
And was never simple      to begin        with
Never trust theater geeks



Marinol3
--------------------------
 A problem over there is another persons problem
so against representation 
that crosses the blood brain barrier
Phenylpiracetam banned in 
several countries, must be some good stuff
Like wires crossed through doorways and handheld momments
a flash in the tip
screwed the baddest bitch
but if you drop ne pray
I land on my head



SuperHighway
--------------------------
Excelerate. get home faster 
 it's all wearkng off. two hundred gone in a few days
 tasting blood in you throat
 they won't notice at wr\ork, they even share
 t    t   they gave me numbers
 \so their buddies can get through a twelve 
 hour shift. Can only keep functioing, keep speeding
          umtoll she gets piseed you wont come over
      or yoou have to ask for a drivers license

WITHOUT_THE_ZEPPELIN


Before_They_Met_Me
--------------------------
      Calls like 
flies on the screen



Done_With_Nothing
--------------------------
The sales socket fills with broken INSERT TITLE
 She'd 	sally	 her own towel
 never mind the one she bought but the one she stole
 crafty like widdowmakers, each sole another life down the drain
 She runs to 	crave	 the last call during
 window shopping for things she could return, could get back and take
 all at the same 	trees	
 
 
 
 
 
 



Holdup
--------------------------
 High tide and holy roller, bound to cross 
 the boarders of bulima, fingers ready to take
 the methadone, that white bottle I see her brother
 take and mix with anything else. The anti high high
 
 he threatened me the first thing
 "you better not hurt my sister"
 I promised and continued walking while he
 slowly drifted from side to side, a capture of
 the sun when a camera won't focus
 like he's dying a little more
 each out of focus day
 



Magic_Sentences
--------------------------
spend your whole life living for the worst thing you've ever done
spend your whole life living for the worst thing you've ever done
spend your whole life living for the worst thing you've ever done
The cusp of cliche that speaks smaller volumes than  you think

The_Return_Of_Marinol
--------------------------
 	converge	for the nightcall
Seduction: strong enough that the knights of the round table turn and get hitched or hit 
		her own self
Taken in round up dosages, from 1/3 to 1/4 depending on your muscle structure 
	cars	: to be beaten in a race by frogs 
torch light lurks far in the dungeon corridor, you're rolling without armour because it's too heavy
No centaurs or minotaurs, all kinds of taurs, taurine and true
Raw river beds that sink into the earth for cave ants and aquaifer bats
Shoot the messanger, because he clearly works the hardest.
I land on my head
