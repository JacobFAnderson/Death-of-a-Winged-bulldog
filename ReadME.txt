__STIMULATION	_OF_	HALTING	 	DAMAGED	__


         To my family and friends,
         who fought for me 
                                 -JA 


Remember that time she slapped your dick
 now, after experts and scientists viewed the footage
even after sherlock himself had looked in on it
maybe it wasn't an accident.

    all for the best
pleasures for 	woozy	 the best
on a broadcast station that
	 won't be written about in
nostaglic forums, never bought up
on to friends or closer friends


Girl_Whisperer
--------------------------
Love on the third look 
better than the sickness of the fourth 
which is a hometown divider on backroads 
If it doesn't happen by the third glance
then fingers       crossed for the   fifth
       if only you looked at the wrong person
       how lucky


Wildabeast
--------------------------
Kept to ourselves when it didn't matter
and paid for her own words, hanging by shroom limelight
christmas lights twisted into shapes and dragons 


WildabeastII
--------------------------
          Wept to the sound of vomtting in the car
you have to pull your head back slightly, straighten out your bull stomach

 Throw the bag in the street because you missed the trashcan
She'll never let me forget it

 but I did 
          brine liquid that could eat up ships
In her eyes, she'll scold me for sushing her in 
in kung fu panda 3
So I told my therapist everything.


Rose
--------------------------
charming 	aggressive	    with     
       a middle name


a          lways call      me with an iphone
pushed against a grill that never      holds 
the light just right

           you better get that iphone
Payments as low as . . . 


Build_IT
--------------------------
determined to blow it out of proportion, I cheated, I didn't cheat enough    
  middle vowel between tongues and legs of obstructions 
Never bold enough, the font, to catch a new infection
sick within hours of the excedrin and for three days after

 I wrecked a toilet and felt bad enough to clean it before the orderlies did

 That virus that people can smell on you, blue river between
killing and killed. Only letters seperate us from the dead


Best_Bundle2
--------------------------
      her tons of bullet mashed clothing 
  ripp    ing the taste out of her mouth 
Metal the last copper test
she   dies within h   ours

 and left her bones for the res t of us



Trust_is_a_closed_Book
--------------------------
Cant catch a cold if you're moving   to      fast
Animals were left in the desert for bland and dumb reasons
you say you're not listening, but I can hear you shift in the air



I_Have_Jameson
--------------------------
I see your eyes in every flower
they're white roses with burnt eyelashes
if only you could be like I want you to be
change the color of your eyes
   your heart
   and the tops of your feet
       never left out in the rain
Change your mind, just a bit faster.



Birth_of_Earth
--------------------------
Let the cat out
when it was   healthier
I have to drag his legs
out from under him
fires in the valley
      burn more than homes
 with ash covering the tips
of trees in the distance
The night never dark again
you'd think of a volcano
and don't go out enough
to fill her quota
dust the bone ash off the flower pots
and carry the cat inside
They let me control my own pain
medication

Outline the roads that are
covered and too hot to
try
Almost drowned on another road
and burning to death would be
the ultimate joke
At 10, that fire crawled
down the mountainside
we had sprinklers on the roof
to put out any stray flames
Firefighters camped out in our yard
with hoses ready
trying to sleep with orange 
puncturing the skys and hillside

The night is never long enough
with the days getting shorter
And catiputling
to the churches destiny
No fire, no water
Away from bullies 
despite all the hep c for the taking
I crush up the cats pills
mix them with rancid food 
that I smell at work from time to time

pull her skin tighter
so pinches will stain her boody
The cat moves on the ground like
a ghoul
The nights are never long enough
But imagine never being able to crawl away

THE_HUNK_AND_I

The_Romantics
--------------------------
Waste space touching old posters and flinging records off the cliff
The sound is crisp, a low low billow that brightens the corners   aces to places
The shards are black obsidion
I burried the record out behind the tree I cut down for her
First love is never enough love
it lasts too               long
burning and pacing the hand you've never drawn

You know something honey? It won't end well
for me, and it won't mean well for you



VirtualGettinIt
--------------------------
 I gave her one, they gave him two

two one, her gives them what they gave  


Virtious_Game_Changer
--------------------------
More More More

phine she screams, when four mg isn't enough
      and ring with your arms up in the air
watch the orderlies play rock paper siccsrs for bringing your meds
and up for seven o clock blood draws for medication levels



Too_Much_Time_With_Chronos
--------------------------
 as flustered I'm persisted
 carried This of sun, conquest. head. and no the
whole the world to see. Poor for pay. Glasses full with anything but water



Follow_with_care
--------------------------
Crafter with loose ships and sinking lips
Cant you see we are working?

 hard on the tip of the dick
Two modes, Horny and Hungry
First kiss doesn't have anything
on curb side blow jobs
Miracle on the eight mile
never letting her drive again



Holding_Gold
--------------------------
 streaked from the hearth to the bathroom 
 feet clicking on rapped tile and wet towels
He checks himself, again, and can't bend it back
 Wasted enough that it doesn't hurt
 but it's going too



Marinol
--------------------------
 Alex smokes some fucking weed 
and pills from under grandmas sink
tried and true. obscure. the dates are always older than me
Bird house in the sink, cumming all in your pants when she comes over
skittles but all by himself
A great many things are wrong with him
 And boils are never as sharp as the tacs



Marinol2
--------------------------
 bowed graced with simple pleasures    god can replace laxatives with m&ms
          trim that water down to fit in the sink
her       ass         breaks      bones
And was never simple      to begin        with
The horse falls ontop of the tv cowboy
and she falls ontop of me.


Marinol3
--------------------------
 A problem over there is another persons problem
so against representation 
that crosses the blood brain barrier
Phenylpiracetam banned in 
several countries, must be some good stuff
Like wires crossed through doorways and handheld momments
a flash in the tip
screwed the baddest bitch
but if you drop knee and pray
I'll land on my head



The_Return_Of_Marinol
--------------------------
 	distribute	for the nightcall
Seduction: strong enough that the knights of the round table turn and get hitched or hit 
	enlarge	her own self
Taken in round up dosages, from 1/3 to 1/4 depending on your muscle structure 
Fox: to be beaten in a race by frogs 
torch light lurks far in the dungeon corridor, you're rolling without armour because it's too heavy
No centaurs or minotaurs, all kinds of taurs, taurine and true
Raw river beds that sink into the earth for cave ants and aquifer bats
Shoot the messanger, because he clearly works the hardest.



SuperHighway
--------------------------
Excelerate. get home faster 
 it's all wearing off. two hundred gone in a few days
 tasting blood in you throat
 they won't notice at w\ork, they even share
 t    t   they gave me numbers
 so their buddies can get through a twelve 
 hour shift. Can only keep functioing, keep speeding
          she gets piseed you wont come over
      Who ask's for a drivers license?

WITHOUT_THE_ZEPPELIN

Before_They_Met_Me
--------------------------
      Calls like 
flies on the screen



Done_With_Nothing
--------------------------
The sales socket fills with broken 	simple	
 She'd 	saddle	 her own towel
 never mind the one she bought but the one she stole
 crafty like widdowmakers, each sole another life down the drain
 She runs to 	dive	 the last call during
 window shopping for things she could return, could get back and take
 all at the same Prostitue



Holdup
--------------------------
 High tide and holy roller, bound to cross 
 the boarders of bulimia, fingers ready to take
 the methadone, that white bottle I see her brother
 take and mix with anything else. The anti high high
 
 he threatened me the first thing
 "you better not hurt my sister"
 I promised and continued walking while he
 slowly drifted from side to side, a capture of
 the sun when a camera won't focus
 like he's dying a little more
 each out of focus day
 



Magic_Sentences
--------------------------
spend your whole life living for the worst thing you've ever done
By night or by water there's really little purpose
ask me questions, wait for a second, then get the text back
I do you though, just so you know, if that makes it easier



Done_and_over
--------------------------
Heart never goes out on the town. What a bubbling mess 
she hears on the updraft her own voice, spaced between the moon and the sky 
limbs brusting with pain, a sepsis tanker that breaks down doors
Her heart turns as sick as can be. Neither marriage nor fucking a pharmacist \ 
 could help. Not really. Once you're used to the drugs 
you use more in health than any other time
Just a taste of pulled bones, your mouth harbors dust



Get_back_on
--------------------------
The shallowers laugh in seperate corners of the yellow house
they want to dine and dash, and Coddle their own selves
Introduce yourself to the cold tile, your feet frosting over in seconds
theres nothing the shallowers can do but judge in the crusted night



Cash_out_with_half
--------------------------
Take a break yourself and lie to another face
barely making a difference in their life
Soda cans can the only roadside attractions
watch as the shore water parts and the clams get out alive
Lighter benzos then soaked sweet tarts
wake up after stealing every painkiller in the box
Shes the ground zero, the scortched slights between her fingers
While Yesterday she sowed more than she planted


Six_Month_Security
--------------------------
Middle of a custody battle with guns and knives
posioned water holes that make you shit your brains out
fresh starts are always tainted, just a little bit rotten from

being so close to the other meat
She won't be either mother, but she's done less drugs and spent less time in jail
Her ex's entire argument is she has a better mouth
a grasp for how the inside really is
if she won, the baby will only be as half as bad
as she was.


Wooden_Lawyer_Table
--------------------------
The offices of slick surfaces and a ripe plastic smelll
Theres store bought cake on the varnish
Plastic forks that cant be used to kill or injure
if there was enough of them, I'm sure someone would get hurt

That's another meeting though



Baby_shoes
--------------------------
She wants to reverse the circumcision with fake plastic and halloween paint 
The second shortest story.
Am age old brain stim bleed that never wakes up
in the shower, or bath, never as long as a break you need
Right to work, left to bottom out
listen to the GPS just one
more
                   time

Hospitals through steam and stains
her cross weighing heavier than her hands
in the last place you look 
        under he legs 

through her a too the door
      carpet bombs that leak
and require a bleach and bones


The_Book_of_Henry_2
--------------------------
Busy social calander
        not enough      wizards
in the kingdom's woods 
        enough  boondoggles 

to make the Mayan timeline start
From day one on
age of aquaducts       and sparse foliage 

*********************
HER_PLAN

pulled_fire
--------------------------
The car pulls away and I regret not looking back one last time
I keep telling her all she needs is xanax
The car pulls away and I regret not looking back one last time
It's nothing like us, we were weaker and higher in the middle of the night



Handjobs_On_Medicaid
--------------------------
Only
       her hands are 
     burned
        maybe 10% body
          fired
 Marsh
               bowling by the 
   middle     lane
Bandages and all



Super_Sputnik
--------------------------
Gleam of windshield moonlight through the bottles in tbe back 
None of them open, boring night with only a few friends in the desert
secrecy of backseat exploits, a moving motel with never enough leg room



caught_on_bones_and_dust
--------------------------
      "Don't they come looking for him?"
       "no, only to vanish into the gold shine."   I didn't want to believe him, they had to be out there
   in the wind, or the settling dust from the dirt road.
I looked at the            discarded dog, and he wags slightly
                               "we'll have to call around."
           Yeah, he can try that.


Rescue
--------------------------
AKA a nice lady, lost in tights
where she begs for coupons on the corner
where she begs for the past of several seconds.
She plays the oldest record and turns off the night



Reach_Out
--------------------------
we have a dialogue
where we play both people
if we are lucky, a third


Reach_OutII
--------------------------
It's all
 out in the 
 open, her sides
 split by a carving knife
 smile like a pumpkin
 frosted ice on the
 waterfront

Our car stalls
and in the night we
slip back
she grabs my hand
and the gearshift
as if her will
actually help 


Hey_Jude
--------------------------
there's nothing like
sleeping in her bed
She has two pushup bras
but not a push up soul.



Bright_Fire
--------------------------
What do we, in the end, keep for ourselves? Not our sins, those leave at confession
Not who we've slept with, those drift out over whisky and time, a pressure cooker of cum
Brass wnads she held, sins and sexplotes, a collection of cowboy figures picked up for nothing
Not our pain, leaves in spurts while still leaving a thin residue in our lungs and body cavity
She laughs at every joke, when I'm being serious. I turn over thisee brass figures in anger.
Not who've we let down, that image is stored on our chest plate, and we shine planes down with it.
We try to keep it all, save it away from the world, because earth scares us. it's put the fear into us.
In the clatter of metal, we mark up every tree for every lover, never thinking the trees can mark back. 


Havent_poisned_anyone
--------------------------
He says it was a long time ago
  broken tail lights on trails in the backwood
We start a fightclub and start slapping each other 
  Too young for smokes but we stole some anyway
The tower and cops in the distance, alerted by flares 
  and mortar shells 
We hide in the bushes and wait for the fuzz to leave
  Never more young then we've ever been.


Snapped''into''place
--------------------------
As the sky outside.
darkened, we cross 
as long as our arms.
The train speeds by flattening a row of pennies.
the sky inside.
glowed
all the watches in the venue
.stopped at the same time

and years later
we kissed

The __epilogue2__
--------------------------
  Time only waits
  and we have 
  to wait 
  with it 

  through the main roads
  and the fields, hours shut us down.
  teenagers riot with minutes
  and addiction moves 
          in seconds
